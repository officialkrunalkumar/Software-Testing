Manual Testing Projects

I would like to introduce my testing skillset and approach to my test approach in Agile Testing through various live projects that I have worked on so far and still continuing in the process.

There are various types of projects, software, and products that I have tested, including Mobile Applications on Android and iOS. Coming on to next, I would like to take you to Website Testing and its cross-browser compatibility testing and the respective test case document. It does not end here; next comes Web Applications testing, that requires in-depth functional and end-to-end testing Module wise.

As am passionate about enhancing the software, playing around with it, and analyzing its quality and behavior with end users in mind, I would like to share my testing project for Chatbot with detailed test case design document.

I would like to take you through the differences in PDFs as part of the test deliverables.

1. Defect Lists,
2. Test Case Design Document,
3. Test Report after Execution,
4. Cross Browser Test Report on all the Windows Browser.
